Q1. How do you load a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
import pandas as pd
df=pd.read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv')

Q2. How do you check the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
df.dtypes

Q3. How do you select rows from a Pandas DataFrame based on a condition?
Ans:-
df_fare=df.loc[df['Fare']>30.00]
df_fare

Q4. How do you rename columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
One way of renaming the columns in a Pandas Dataframe is by using the rename() function. This method is quite useful when we need to rename some selected columns because we need to specify information only for the columns which are to be renamed. 

Q5. How do you drop columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
df.drop('new_col',axis=1,Inplace=True)

Q6. How do you find the unique values in a column of a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
df['pclass'].unique()

Q7. How do you find the number of missing values in each column of a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
df.isnull()

Q8. How do you fill missing values in a Pandas DataFrame with a specific value?
Ans:-
The fillna() function iterates through your dataset and fills all empty rows with a specified value. This could be the mean, median, modal, or any other value.

Q9. How do you concatenate two Pandas DataFrames?
Ans:-
A concatenation of two or more data frames can be done using pandas.concat() method. concat() in pandas works by combining Data Frames across rows or columns. We can concat two or more data frames either along rows (axis=0) or along columns (axis=1).

Q10. How do you merge two Pandas DataFrames on a specific column?
Ans:-
We can merge two Pandas DataFrames on certain columns using the merge function by simply specifying the certain columns for merge. 

Syntax: DataFrame.merge(right, how=’inner’, on=None, left_on=None, right_on=None, left_index=False, right_index=False, sort=False, copy=True, indicator=False, validate=None)

Q11. How do you group data in a Pandas DataFrame by a specific column and apply an aggregation function?
Ans:-
Pandas' apply() function applies a function along an axis of the DataFrame. When using it with the GroupBy function

Q12. How do you pivot a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
The pivot() function is used to reshaped a given DataFrame organized by given index / column values. This function does not support data aggregation, multiple values will result in a MultiIndex in the columns.

Q13. How do you change the data type of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
The DataFrame.astype() method is used to cast a pandas column to the specified dtype. 

Q14. How do you sort a Pandas DataFrame by a specific 
Ans:-
We can sort by column values in pandas DataFrame using sort_values() method. To specify the order, we have to use ascending boolean property; False for descending and True for ascending. By default, it is set to True.

Q15. How do you create a copy of a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
The copy() method returns a copy of the DataFrame. By default, the copy is a "deep copy" meaning that any changes made in the original DataFrame will NOT be reflected in the copy.

Q16. How do you filter rows of a Pandas DataFrame by multiple conditions?
Ans:-
The loc function in pandas can be used to access groups of rows or columns by label. Add each condition we want to be included in the filtered result and concatenate them with the & operator. we'll see our code sample will return a pd. dataframe of our filtered rows.

Q17. How do you calculate the mean of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
To get column average or mean from pandas DataFrame use either mean() and describe() method. The DataFrame. mean() method is used to return the mean of the values for the requested axis.

Q18. How do you calculate the standard deviation of a column in a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
Standard deviation is calculated using the function . std() . However, the Pandas library creates the Dataframe object and then the function . std() is applied on that Dataframe .

Q19. How do you calculate the correlation between two columns in a Pandas DataFrame?
Ans:-
By using corr() function we can get the correlation between two columns in the dataframe

Q20. How do you select specific columns in a DataFrame using their labels?
Ans:-
This is the most basic way to select a single column from a dataframe, just put the string name of the column in brackets. Returns a pandas series. Passing a list in the brackets lets you select multiple columns at the same time.

Q21. How do you select specific rows in a DataFrame using their indexes?
Ans:-
By selecting the Rows by Index in Pandas DataFrame using iloc ... The iloc[ ] is used for selection based on position

Q22. How do you sort a DataFrame by a specific column?
Ans:-
To sort the DataFrame based on the values in a single column, we'll use . sort_values() . By default, this will return a new DataFrame sorted in ascending order. It does not modify the original DataFrame.

Q23. How do you create a new column in a DataFrame based on the values of another column?
Ans:-
The first and most practical way of adding a new column based on another is using the Pandas apply function.

Q24. How do you remove duplicates from a DataFrame?
Ans:-
Pandas drop_duplicates() method helps in removing duplicates from the Pandas Dataframe In Python. 

Q25. What is the difference between .loc and .iloc in Pandas?
Ans:-
The main difference between pandas loc[] vs iloc[] is loc gets DataFrame rows & columns by labels/names and iloc[] gets by integer Index/position.
